# Sketch2art-pytorch
The pytorch implementation of the paper: Sketch-to-Art: Synthesizing Stylized Art Images From Sketches

This repo only provides the three proposed modules in the paper: DMI, FMT, and IDN.
These are plug-and-play modules that can be applied to general Pix2Pix model for 
sketch-to-image synthesis tasks.
